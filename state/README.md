# State Design Pattern in Python

Explore the State design pattern in Python ğŸš¦, a powerful method for managing object behavior changes based on internal state variations.

## Introduction

ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to the State Design Pattern section! Design patterns offer structured solutions to recurring design problems, and the State pattern is instrumental in managing object states seamlessly.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we demonstrate the State pattern, enabling objects to alter their behavior when their internal state changes. This pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior and facilitates state transitions. ğŸš€

### eCommerce Checkout Example

We've implemented an eCommerce checkout scenario, showcasing the State pattern's practical use. States such as 'CartEmpty', 'ItemsAdded', 'ShippingInfoEntered', and 'PaymentProcessed' manage the checkout process flow. ğŸ›’ğŸ’³
