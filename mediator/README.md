# Mediator Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Mediator design pattern in Python 🤝, a powerful architectural solution for managing communication between components.

## Introduction

✨ Welcome to the Mediator Design Pattern section! Design patterns offer structured approaches to software design, and the Mediator pattern excels in centralizing component interactions.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, delve into the Mediator pattern's essence. It allows for indirect component communication through a mediator object, reducing direct dependencies and enhancing flexibility. 🚀

### Message Broker Demonstration

This implementation showcases the Mediator pattern's capabilities with a simple Message Broker. Witness how the mediator facilitates communication between message senders and receivers, demonstrating the pattern's practicality in system coordination. 📨💬
