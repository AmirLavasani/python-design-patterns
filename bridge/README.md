# Bridge Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Bridge design pattern in Python ðŸŒ‰, a structural pattern that separates abstraction from implementation, offering flexibility and scalability.

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Bridge Design Pattern section! Design patterns provide effective solutions to common software challenges, and the Bridge pattern is a valuable tool for decoupling abstraction from implementation.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Bridge pattern, which allows the creation of platform-independent classes and applications. This pattern promotes code flexibility and maintenance by separating high-level abstractions from platform-specific details. ðŸš€

### File Storage Abstraction

This implementation showcases the Bridge pattern's capabilities by creating a file storage abstraction with different implementations for local storage, cloud storage, and network storage. We demonstrate how the pattern enables easy switching between storage options without modifying core logic. ðŸ’¾
