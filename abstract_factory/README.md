# Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Abstract Factory design pattern in Python 🏭, a powerful tool for creating families of related or dependent objects.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Abstract Factory Design Pattern section! Design patterns are essential tools in software engineering, and the Abstract Factory pattern is a key player in creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

1. **Basic Structure**

In this section, we'll dive into the fundamental structure of the Abstract Factory pattern. Learn about the key components, including the Abstract Factory interface, concrete factories, abstract products, and concrete products. Discover how this pattern encapsulates object creation and ensures compatibility among created objects. 🚀

2. **Practical Implementation: Notification Service**

Explore a real-world example of the Abstract Factory pattern in action. We'll build a multi-channel notification service that supports email, SMS, and push notifications. See how the pattern simplifies the creation of notification objects for different delivery channels and platforms. Experience the power of abstracting complex object creation. 🔮
