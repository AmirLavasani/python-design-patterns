# Singleton Design Pattern in Python

In this sectoion, you'll find implementations of the Singleton design pattern in Python using three different methods:

1. **Basic Implementation**: The simplest way to create a Singleton instance, ensuring that only one instance exists throughout the lifetime of your application. ðŸš€

2. **Implementation with Decorators**: A more elegant approach using Python decorators to achieve Singleton behavior with minimal code. âœ¨

3. **Implementation with Python's MetaClass**: An advanced method utilizing Python's metaclasses to enforce Singleton rules. ðŸ”®

## Usage ðŸ§°

Each implementation can be found in its respective file, along with code examples and explanations. You can explore and compare these methods to better understand the Singleton design pattern in Python.

## Additional Resources ðŸ“š

For a more detailed explanation of the Singleton design pattern in Python and a deeper dive into these implementations, refer to my Medium article on the topic: <a href="https://medium.com/@amirm.lavasani/design-patterns-in-python-singleton-5095a4c14f" target="_blank">Design Patterns in Python: Singleton</a>.

Feel free to use these implementations in your projects and contribute to this repository to enhance our understanding of this important design pattern. Happy coding! ðŸš€
