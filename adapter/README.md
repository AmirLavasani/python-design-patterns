# Adapter Design Pattern in Python

Discover the Adapter design pattern in Python ðŸ§©, a versatile solution for integrating incompatible interfaces.

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Adapter Design Pattern section! Design patterns are vital tools in software engineering, and the Adapter pattern is a crucial one for making different interfaces work seamlessly together.

### Class Adapter Implementation

In the Class Adapter implementation, we explore how to use inheritance to create an adapter that makes incompatible interfaces compatible. This pattern allows for interface translation and promotes code reusability. ðŸš€

### Object Adapter Implementation

The Object Adapter implementation demonstrates how to achieve interface compatibility using object composition. We wrap the incompatible class with an adapter class, ensuring smooth collaboration between objects with different interfaces. ðŸ§©
