# Proxy Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Proxy Design Pattern in Python 🛡️, a versatile pattern that provides controlled access to objects and enhances their functionality.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Proxy Design Pattern section! Design patterns are essential tools in software engineering, and the Proxy pattern is a valuable asset for managing object interactions while maintaining control, security, and performance.

### Basic Structure

In this section, we'll delve into the core structure of the Proxy pattern. Learn about its essential components, such as the Real Subject, Proxy, and Proxy Interface. Discover how it acts as an intermediary to control access to the Real Subject, providing a level of indirection. 🚀

### Practical Implementation: Monitoring Proxy for Performance Metrics

Explore a real-world example of the Proxy pattern in action. We'll implement a Monitoring Proxy that tracks the runtime of a time-consuming operation. Witness how the Proxy pattern helps monitor performance without altering the Real Subject's behavior and enables on-demand object instantiation. Experience the power of controlled access and enhanced functionality. 🔍

### Practical Implementation: Caching Proxy for Database Queries

Discover another real-world use case of the Proxy pattern. We'll implement a Caching Proxy designed to store frequently accessed query results in database applications. See how the Proxy optimizes data retrieval by serving cached results, reducing the load on the database server. Learn how controlled access enhances system performance. 📈
