# Iterator Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Iterator design pattern in Python ðŸ”„, a powerful technique for traversing collections seamlessly.

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Iterator Design Pattern section! Design patterns offer elegant solutions to common programming challenges, and the Iterator pattern simplifies the traversal of collections, abstracting iteration details.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Iterator pattern, enabling effortless traversal through collections without exposing their underlying structure. This pattern abstracts iteration logic, enhancing code flexibility and readability. ðŸš€

### Standard and Python-Specific Iterators

We've implemented both standard iterators and Python-specific iterators utilizing the `__iter__()` function built within Python. This demonstrates the pattern's adaptability and its native integration in Python's syntax.
