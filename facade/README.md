# Facade Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Facade design pattern in Python 🐍, a structural pattern simplifying complex subsystem interactions.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Facade Design Pattern section! Design patterns offer elegant solutions to software design challenges, and the Facade pattern excels at providing a unified interface to a complex system.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Facade pattern, which creates a single interface to interact with a complex subsystem. This simplifies the usage and management of intricate subsystem components. 

### Unified Payment Gateway

We showcase the power of the Facade pattern by implementing a unified payment gateway handling various payment methods like Visa, Stripe, and Bitcoin. 💳💰 This demonstrates how the Facade pattern simplifies interactions with diverse subsystems, offering a cohesive interface for multiple gateways. 🌐
