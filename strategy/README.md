# Strategy Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Strategy design pattern in Python ðŸš€, a dynamic approach for selecting and employing different algorithms at runtime.

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Strategy Design Pattern section! Design patterns provide elegant solutions to recurring software design problems, and the Strategy pattern is an invaluable tool for algorithmic flexibility.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Strategy pattern, offering the ability to choose and switch between algorithms within an object. This pattern fosters a flexible and interchangeable approach to algorithm utilization. ðŸ”„

### Trading Strategy System ðŸ“ˆ

This implementation showcases the Strategy pattern's real-world application by building a trading strategy system. Experience the power of dynamically selecting different trading strategies, such as Moving Average and Mean Reversion, during runtime. ðŸ’¹
