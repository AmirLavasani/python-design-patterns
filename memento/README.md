# Memento Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Memento design pattern in Python 🕰️, a powerful technique for capturing and restoring an object's state.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Memento Design Pattern section! The Memento pattern facilitates the capture and restoration of an object's state, preserving its previous conditions and allowing reverting to earlier states.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Memento pattern, which enables objects to capture snapshots of their state without exposing their implementation details. This approach fosters undo mechanisms and state recovery within applications. 🔄

### Game Save System

This implementation demonstrates the Memento pattern's practical application in creating a game save system. A practical example showcases how the pattern can restore a saved game to its previous state, ensuring players can revert to earlier stages of gameplay. 🎮
