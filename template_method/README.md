# Template Method Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Template Method design pattern in Python 🎭, a blueprint for defining the skeleton of an algorithm while allowing customization by subclasses.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Template Method Design Pattern section! Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems, and the Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for structuring algorithms with extensibility.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Template Method pattern, facilitating the creation of algorithmic templates with shared structures. This pattern allows subclasses to customize specific steps while preserving the overall algorithmic framework. 🚀

### Web Scraper Template

To illustrate the capabilities of the Template Method, we implement a Web Scraper Template. This showcases how the pattern can be used in a practical example, providing a standardized structure for web scraping while allowing customization of specific steps. 🌐
