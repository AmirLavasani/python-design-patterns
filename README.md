# Design Patterns in Python

Welcome to the "Design Patterns in Python" repository! This collection of Python code examples demonstrates various design patterns to help you understand and implement best practices in your software development projects.

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems. They provide a structured and efficient way to address common challenges while promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. In this repository, we explore a variety of design patterns and provide Python implementations for each.

## Table of Contents

Each design pattern is organized in its own directory within this repository. You can find code examples and explanations for the following patterns:

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- etc
