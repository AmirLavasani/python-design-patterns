# Visitor Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Visitor design pattern in Python 🚶‍♂️, a powerful technique for representing operations to be performed on elements of an object structure.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Visitor Design Pattern section! Design patterns provide solutions to common software challenges, and the Visitor pattern offers a way to define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### Basic Implementation

In the basic implementation, we delve into the Visitor pattern, which separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This allows for the creation of new operations without altering the object structure. 🌐

### Document Exporter Example

This implementation includes a practical example of a Document Exporter application using the Visitor pattern. The Document Exporter allows different exports (e.g., HTML, PDF) of documents with the same structure, showcasing the flexibility of the Visitor pattern. 📄
