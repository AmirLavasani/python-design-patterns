# Composite Design Pattern in Python

Explore the Composite design pattern in Python 🌿, a structural pattern for composing objects into tree structures.

## Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Composite Design Pattern section! The Composite pattern provides a solution for treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It's ideal for building hierarchical structures.

### Basic Implementation

In this basic implementation, delve into the Composite pattern's essence. It demonstrates the unification of objects and collections to create a cohesive hierarchy, simplifying the management of complex structures. 🎛️

### JSON Parser Showcase

Our implementation showcases the Composite pattern's capabilities by constructing a simple JSON parser. It highlights how the pattern elegantly handles hierarchical data, treating individual elements and collections uniformly. 🗃️💡
